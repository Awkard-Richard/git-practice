# Hello Git and GitHub

* This readme document is an initial attempt at using markdown.

* This first section of the readme text was written in the bash CLI with the nano command  within VSCode and committed from there.

* It should be noted that if your readme document is not an .md file, perhaps a .txt file, then your markdown won't render in GitHub (at least not automatically).

* It also appears that you need to insert a line space between paragraphs to effect the rendering of a new line _reference the attached screenshot_
