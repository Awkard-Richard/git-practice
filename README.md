# Hello Git and GitHub

*This readme document is an initial attempt at using markdown.

*This first section of the readme text was written in the bash CLI with the nano command  within VSCode and committed from there.
*It should be noted that if your readme document is not an /.md file, perhaps a /.txt file, then your markdown won't render in GitHub (at least not automatically).
